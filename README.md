# Continuous Space Topic Model

## Description

implementation of [Modeling Text through Gaussian Processes](http://chasen.org/~daiti-m/paper/nl213cstm.pdf)

ABSTRACT:
>This paper proposes a continous space text model based on Gaussian processes. Introducing latent coordinates of words over which the Gaussian process is defined, we can encode word correlations directly and lead to a model that performs better than mixture models. Our model would serve as a foundation of more complex text models and also as a statistical visualization of texts.
